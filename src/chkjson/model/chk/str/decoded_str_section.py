""" "STR " - String Data.

Required for all versions and all game types (or STRx). Validation: Must be at least 1
byte.

Note, since StarCraft Remastered, the "STRx" section is also possible and it optionally
replaces the STR section.

Note, the encoding of text in the STR section is unspecified. Common encodings are
CP-1252, CP-949, and later, UTF-8, (but anything is possible)

This section contains all the strings in the map.

u16: Number of strings in the section (Default: 1024) u16[Number of strings]: 1 integer
for each string specifying the offset (the spot where the string starts in the section
from the start of it). Strings: After the offsets, this is where every string in the map
goes, one after another. Each one is terminated by a null character. This section can
contain more or less than 1024 string offsets and will work in Starcraft. By default,
the first byte in Strings is a NUL character, and all unused offsets in the STR section
point to this NUL character. Note that STR sections can be stacked in a similar fashion
as MTXM
